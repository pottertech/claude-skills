# Skills

AI skills for founders, sales teams, creators, and developers. Install them in Claude Code, use them in Claude Projects, or drop them into any AI agent that reads markdown.

Each skill is a standalone prompt that makes your AI assistant dramatically better at a specific task. No API keys, no setup, no dependencies.

Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex), and any tool that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io).

## Coding Skills — Stop Vibe Coding

A planning + execution pipeline that takes you from raw idea to shipped, tested, production-ready code — even if you've never written a line. Pick the manual planning path if you want full control, or the fast path if you trust the AI to make sensible defaults.

```
PLANNING — pick one
  /grill-me  →  /write-a-prd     Manual path: interactive grilling, then PRD
                    OR
  /shape                          Fast path: auto-grill + PRD in one shot
       ↓
EXECUTION
  /prd-to-issues                  Break the PRD into bite-sized tasks
       ↓
  /ralph                          AI implements each task with TDD + code review
```

`/grill-me`, `/write-a-prd`, and `/prd-to-issues` are from [Matt Pocock](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). `/shape` and `/ralph` are the additions that close the loop.

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| [shape](coding/shape/) | Fast-path planning. Walks the full decision tree (edge cases, modules, schema, testing, security) by self-answering with software-engineering best practices, streams the Q&A live so you can spot bad assumptions, and writes a PRD locally with an option to push as a GitHub issue. Same PRD format as `/write-a-prd`, so the rest of the pipeline accepts it unchanged. |
| [ralph](coding/ralph/) | Autonomous implementation loop — picks up GitHub issues one by one, implements with TDD, runs a code review gate after every commit, and keeps going until the PRD is done. Human-in-the-loop or fully autonomous in a Docker sandbox. |

**Install the full pipeline:**

```bash
# Manual planning skills (credit: Matt Pocock — github.com/mattpocock/skills)
npx skills@latest add mattpocock/skills -s grill-me

## How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files that define how an AI assistant should behave for a specific task. They include the persona, workflow, questions to ask, output format, and rules. Drop a skill file where your AI agent reads instructions, and it just works.

No framework. No runtime. No dependencies. Just a well-written prompt.
